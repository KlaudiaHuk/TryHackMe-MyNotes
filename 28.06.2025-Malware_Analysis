Malware Analysis

Malware Analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand:
What it does
How it works
How it spreads
How to detect and remove it

Goals of Malware Analysis:
Identify behavior and damage
Find communication with external servers (C2)
Detect evasion techniques
Create detection signatures (e.g. YARA, IOC)
Help in incident response and defense

Types of Malware Analysis:

Static - Analyze the file without running it - strings, GHidra, PEStudio

Dynamic - Run the malware in a safe environment - Cuckoo Sandbox, Procmon

Behavioral - Observe what the malware does (files, RAM) - Regshot, Wireshark

Reverse Eng. - Deep code analysis (disassembly) - IDA Pro, x64dbg, Ghidra

Example Workflow:
Receive suspicious .exe
Use strings to extract readable content
Run in sandbox to observe behavior
Monitor network traffic and system changes
Report findings and build detection rules
