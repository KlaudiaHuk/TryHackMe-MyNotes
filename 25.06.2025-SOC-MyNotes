What I Learned today:
Security Operations Center (My notes)

SOC stands for Security Operations Center.
It is a centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in real time.
Key Funcions of a SOC:
24/7 monitoring of networks and systems
Detecting malicious activity (e.g. malware, Phishing, unauthorized access)
Investigating security alerts
Responding to ancidents and mitigating threats
Improving overall security posture
Common Tools Used in SOC:
SIEM (e.g. CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)
Network analysis tools (Wireshark, tcpdump)
Threat intelligence (VirusTotal, Shodan, MISP)

A SOC is the first line of defense in cybersecurity. It protects an organization by identifying and reacting to threats as quickly as possible.
