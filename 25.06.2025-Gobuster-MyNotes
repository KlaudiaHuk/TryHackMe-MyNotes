What I learned today:
Gobuster (My notes)

Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Debian:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gobuster
gobuster --help

Gobuster is a command-line tool written in Go, used in offensive security for brute-force enumeration of:
Web directories and files 
Virtual hosts(vhosts)
DNS subdomains
It is commonly used during penetration testing, reconnaissance, and CTF(Capture The Flag) challenges to discover hidden resources on web servers.
Key Features:
Fast and efficient due to Go's concurrency
Supports file extensions (-x)
Can detect directories, subdomains, and virtual hosts

Go
Go, also known as Golang, is a modern programming language created by Google in 2009. It combines the speed and performance of low-level languages (like C) with the simplicity of high-level languages (like Python).
Why is Go popular in cybersecurity?
Fast and lightweight - ideal for tools like Gobuster, Amass, Subfinder
Creates single executable files - no dependencies required
great for building CLI tools and automation
Efficient for tasks like brute-forcing, scanning and enumeration
