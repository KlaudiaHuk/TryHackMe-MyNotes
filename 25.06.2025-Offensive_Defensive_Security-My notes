What I Learned Today: 
Offensive Security vs defensive security (My notes)

Offensive Security
A branch of cybersecurity focused on simulating attacks to identify system weaknesses. Experts learn to think like hackers to test how secure a system really is - all done ethically and legally.
Goal:
Discover vulnerabilities 
Test real-world resistance
Prepare for actual threats
Examples of actions:
Penetration testing 
Phishing simulations
Privlege escalation
Exploit and payload development

Defensive Security 
Focused on protecting systems from attacks. Defensive roles detect, block, and respond to threats in real-time.
Goal:
Prevent breaches
Monitor network activity
Respond quickly and recover
Examples of actions:
Managing firewalls and antivirus
Log analysis 
Incident response
Updating and patching systems
