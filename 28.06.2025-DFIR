Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

Together, they help detect, respond to, and investigate cyberattacks.

Digital Forensics:
Investigates what happened during a cyberattack
Finds and preserves digital evidence (for court, reports, analysis)
Looks into hard drives, memory, log files, deleted data
Answers: Who attacked us? When? How? What was stolen?

Incident Response:
Responds to active or recent cyberattacks
Stops the threat (e.g. malware, intrusion)
Isolates infected systems
Restores services
Prevents the attack from spreading or happening again

DFIR Workflow Example:
Attack happens
IR: Shut it down, isolate systems
DF: Investigate and find the root cause
Report + lessons learned
