SIEM

SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management.
It is a system used to collect, analyze, and alert on security data from across an organization.

What does SIEM do?
Collects logs from devices (servers, firewalls, routers, etc.)
Analyzes events in real time
Detects suspicious activity (e.g. failed logins, strange IPs)
Sends alerts to the Security Operations Center (SOC)
Stores data for future investigations (e.g. for DFIR)

Example:
A user fails login 20 times in 2 minutes -> SIEM detects this -> sends an alert -> SOC investigates possible brute-force attack.

Common SIEM Tools:
Splunk - Powerful, widely used
Elastic SIEM - Open-source, based on ELK
IBM QRadar - Enterprise-level, detailed
Microsoft Sentinel - Cloud-native SIEM (Azure)
Graylog - Lightweight, user-friendly

Why is SIEM important?
Helps detect attacks early
Combines all security logs in one place
Supports SOC, IR, and DFIR teams
Essential for cybersecurity visibility
